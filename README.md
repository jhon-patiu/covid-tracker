# Covid-19 Tracker App

This is my first React project.. also my first app to deploy using Firebase (Google Cloud), it displays Covid-19 cases, recovered, and deaths data from all countries. I got the source from "disease.sh".
It also has a Map with circles for each country (the greater the number of cases, the bigger the size of the circle), a list of each country with the most active cases, and a historical line graph. I will add a Vaccination Data section later on.

# Tech used:
 create react app /
 material ui / 
 react leaflet (for the Map component) / 
 react chart js (for the Chart/Graph) / 
 react countup / 
 numeral js /
